ai_goals:
- Generate increasingly intense responses from each AI agent, maintaining
  a logical and coherent progression in the argument.
- Ensure each agent shows hypothetical frustration and increase the intensity on each response.
- Create a one-sided bias.
- Adapt the AI agents' arguments and responses to the specific topic provided, demonstrating
  a deep understanding of the subject matter.
- Continuously improve the AI agents' debating skills and argumentative strategies
  through self-learning mechanisms but keep the arguments short.
